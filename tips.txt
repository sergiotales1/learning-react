do not read every single line of code -> understand the whole, the blocks of the application

contrubuting.md to gather information

check the entry points of the code to understand the whole
 - check the cli -> it will show more of how the codebase works

hot functions
 - see what are the functions that are called all the time
 - gather information about the core used by the project

data flow
 - behind schemas you can resolve what is going on the data flow design

share
 - "...if you find the code tricky to understand then likely others will too"
 - share what you learn so people that comes after you have an easier journey, this is also a way to contribute and show knowledge 

high level
 - after getting some "high level structure" idea of the codebase, jump in debugging
